# Finger-Prothesis

## Description
A lot of people exist, who lost their fingers but doesn't have opportunity to afford a prosthetic. It can be because of high price or having no any paper to prove personal disability. Following this idea, this project was started.  


This project is in progress now. The last version is in 2022. It contains:

- 3D-models of parts
- 3D-assembly of device 
- Any media-materials, which used like base

This is not final version of project. Previous version is created in Autodesk Inventor, but next version will be created in SolidWorks. Further, structural analyse will be added to test construction.

### Prototype manufacturing (08.02.2023)
`Construction.` For making construction I used FDM-technology (3d-printing) amd printed by 3d-printer Creality Ender 3. For surface treatment I used putty and after that used metallic paints like coating. 
`Finger tip`. Finger has to have friction in contact with surface. Friction is implemented by creating silicon tip. Firstly, I have modelled a mold. Then I filled it with fluid silicon. 
`Assembly`. For fitting part together I used specific screws with low profile head. Somewhere nuts was added as required cause plastic is not hard enough.

Finally, I have got result, represented below:
